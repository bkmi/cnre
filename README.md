# Contrastive Neural Ratio Estimation / Amortized Approximate Likelihood-ratio Estimation
Extending amortized approximate likelihood-ratio estimation / neural ratio estimation to the contrastive case, while staying consistent with the original work.

## the folders explained:
- cnre (the package itself)
- infinite (the hydra script folder for all experiments, the benchmarking location)
- remote (packages that our repository depends on)

## how we produced our data
The data was produced by a script within the "infinite" folder. The relevant calls are written down in a markdown file called `calls.md`. They're grouped by which section of the "experiments" they correspond.
